# MyAppNumberShapes
An app to check whether the number inputed is square, triangular, both, or neither.

To test for a Triangular Number, we use the definiton where 8*num + 1 is a perfect square.

To test for a Perfect Square, we compare the square of the double square root of the number, with the int square root of the number.
